# **BF6 ESP UI – See Everything, Miss Nothing**

**Description:**
In *Battlefield 6*, knowledge is power—and with the **ESP UI**, you’ll have more intel than the entire enemy team combined. ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) overlays critical game data directly on your screen—showing player positions, health, loot, and more—so you can predict movements, dodge ambushes, and strike with precision.

This isn’t just about wallhacks—it’s about **complete situational awareness**.
